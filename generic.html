									<h1>About<br />
									Jared</h1>
									<p>Hello, my name is Jared Torres, and I am pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration in Management 
										Information Systems (MIS) at the University of Houston.</p>
										<p>My fascination with technology began early, as I was intrigued by how it simplifies and enhances everyday functions. During high school, I learned to cut hair, recognizing it as a valuable skill to help fund my tuition, and at 17, I had the opportunity to open my own barbershop in my local community. Although the initial stages were challenging due to my lack of industry experience, the support of my family helped the business thrive. It was during this time that I fully appreciated the transformative power of technology, as I explored ways to integrate it into my business to increase efficiency, such as marketing online, using Google Business to track growth and analytics, and optimizing processes. These experiences deepened my interest in technology and sparked a desire to be on the other side of innovationâ€”developing and implementing technological solutions, ultimately leading me to pursue a degree in Management Information Systems at the University of Houston.</p>

								<p>At the University of Houston, I have been actively involved in MISSO, a student organization for MIS students, where I expanded my professional development and had the privilege of mentoring students who are just beginning their academic journey. Additionally, I led a team of five to secure 1st place in a case competition that involved analyzing over 5,000 transactions. Using advanced data analysis techniques, I identified operational inefficiencies and developed technology-driven solutions to optimize processes and improve decision-making. My time at Bauer also included academic projects that enhanced my technical expertise in consulting and project management. Notably, I partnered with a nonprofit organization to assess their operational challenges and implement tailored IT solutions. By leveraging data modeling, workflow automation, and process optimization, I addressed their business needs effectively, demonstrating my ability to bridge technology and strategy to deliver measurable outcomes. These experiences have solidified my skills in using IT tools and methodologies to solve complex problems and drive innovation in real-world settings.</p>
							<p>In my internship, I am currently performing control testing for both IT and manual controls to analyze risks and ensure SOX compliance. Working closely with Process Leads and Managers, I assess the effectiveness of controls in IT systems and financial processes, evaluating business activities through strategic, financial, operational, and compliance reviews. By analyzing risk management and compliance procedures, I provide insights to improve internal controls, streamline processes, and enhance overall IT governance. These experiences, along with my academic work, have shaped my passion for using technology to solve complex business challenges. From managing my own barbershop and leveraging technology to improve efficiency, to excelling in case competitions and gaining hands-on experience in IT compliance and governance, I have developed a strong foundation in IT solutions, data analysis, and process optimization. I am eager to leverage my technical expertise and business acumen to drive innovation and enhance organizational practices, and as I approach the completion of my degree, I am excited to pursue opportunities that will allow me to apply my skills to impactful projects and further develop my career in the ever-evolving field of IT.</p>
