									<h1>Shop X<br />
									(1st Place)</h1>
									<p>Shop X is a fictional company created for the case competition. The competition involved working in a team of five to analyze over 5,000 transactional records provided by Shop X. The goal was to evaluate the data and develop innovative business solutions to address key challenges.</p>
									<ul class="actions special">

									</ul>
									<p>As the assigned team leader, I guided our team in identifying two critical deficiencies in Shop X's operations. Using analytical data and commercial judgment, we proposed actionable solutions to resolve these issues. While reviewing the data, we identified several inefficiencies in Shop X's performance. However, we focused on addressing the two most significant problems to deliver impactful and well-rounded recommendations. </p>

								<p>We proposed vendor alignment for specific products. Before, each vendor was able to ship every product, but we analyzed the data and identified which vendor shipped at a faster rate while maintaining performance. We recommended keeping all vendors but assigning them to specific products to maximize efficiency and reduce delays.</p>
							<p>We also proposed Shop X+, a membership program offering express shipping benefits. This program encourages customers to choose express shipping by providing rewards over time, increasing retention and fostering repeat purchases. Our goal was to boost the percentage of clients using express shipping from 52% to 70%, enhancing customer satisfaction and delivery efficiency.</p>
							<p>Finally, we presented our solutions to a panel of professional consultants, demonstrating the feasibility and impact. Our presentation earned 1st place out of 19 teams, showcasing the effectiveness of our data-driven approach and innovative strategies.</p>
